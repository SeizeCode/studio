## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) to convey trustworthiness and a dynamic spirit, suggesting forward movement and ambition.
- Background color: Light sky blue (#E1F5FE), offering a calm and supportive feeling while maintaining visual consistency with the primary color.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF8C00) to draw attention to calls to action and interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, for a modern yet readable look.
- Use modern, flat-style icons representing cricket gear, events, and facilities. Color the icons with the accent color to emphasize them.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout, leveraging Angular Material's components for a consistent and responsive design.
- Subtle animations for the sliding banner and page transitions. When the user advances a panel in the carousel, the images and text should smoothly cross-fade in and out. When new content loads, use slide-in animations
